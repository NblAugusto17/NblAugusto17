## ⚡**ABOUT ME**
I am a Data Scientist who has started their career in Geophysics, bridging the gap between scientific rigor and business intelligence. My background in Geophysics taught me how to model complex systems and handle high-uncertainty data—skills I now apply to build predictive models that drive better decision-making.

### What moves me:
- 📊 Risk Analysis
- 📉 Predictive Modeling
- 💡 Problem Solving
